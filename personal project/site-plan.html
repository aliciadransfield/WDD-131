			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the home page] My content isn't all here yet because it's a project that I'm currently doing and is due the 18th </p>

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>I began this project by researching <em>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em>. I listened to the book, studied early covers and illustrations, and identified recurring themes and motifs. I also explored visual elements that are instantly recognizable as “Wonderland,” such as the White Rabbit, the tea party, and the playing cards. In addition, I examined the characters and what makes the story so distinctive and imaginative.</p>

			<img src="images/Research.jpg">

			<h2>Thumbnails</h2>
			<p>After completing my research, I created both typographic and illustration based thumbnails. My goal was to develop at least ten variations of typographic and illustration based covers and explore different ways to visually combine key aspects of <em>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em>. For example, I experimented with turning a teacup into Alice’s hat, visualizing the idea of “following the White Rabbit,” and representing the theme of confusion through type layout and composition.</p>
			<img src="images/Thumbnails 1.jpg">
			<img src="images/Thumbnails 2.jpg">

			<h2>Development</h2>
			<p>From my thumbnails, I selected the eight strongest concepts, four typographic and four illustrative, to develop further. I chose fonts and colors that reflected the story’s whimsical tone and began refining the designs in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. During this stage, I discovered that not everything translates perfectly from sketch to digital form, which required several adjustments, such as repositioning the title and refining color balance.</p>
